/**
capture(regex, reducers, accumulator, string)
Parse `string` with `regex`, calling functions in `reducers` to modify
and return `accumulator`.

Reducers is an object of functions keyed by the index of their capturing
group in the regexp result (`0` corresponding to the entire regex match,
the first capturing group being at index `1`). Reducer functions are
called in capture order for all capturing groups that captured something.
Reducers may also define the function 'done', which is called at the end
of every capture. All reducer functions are passed the paremeters
`(accumulator, tokens)`, where `tokens` is the regexp result, and are expected
to return a value that is passed as an accumulator to the next reducer function.

Reducers may also define a function `'catch'`, which is called when a match
has not been made (where `'catch'` is not defined an error is thrown).

```js
const parseValue = capture(/^\s*(-?\d*\.?\d+)(\w+)?\s*$/, {
    // Create a new accumulator object each call
    0: () => ({}),

    1: (acc, tokens) => {
        acc.number = parseFloat(tokens[1]);
        return acc;
    },

    2: (acc, tokens) => {
        acc.unit = tokens[2];
        return acc;
    }
}, null);

const value = parseValue('36rem');    // { number: 36, unit: 'rem' }
```

    // If tokens is undefined exec has failed to apply regex to string
    return output === undefined ?
        // If there is a catch function, call it, otherwise error out
        reducers.catch ?
            reducers.catch(acc, string) :
            error(regex, reducers, string) :

        // Return the accumulator
