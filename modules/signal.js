/**
Signal()
Signal(fn)

Creates an object that encapsulates a value and notifies when the value becomes
invalid, out of date, irrelevant, historic, old. It has, essentially, one property,
`.value`.

Setting `.value` caches that value and invalidates any signals that depend on
this signal. Getting `.value` returns the cached value â€“ or, if the cache is
invalid, evaluates a new value by calling `fn()`, where it exists.

Signals implement `.valueOf()` and so in some contexts they may be used directly
where a primitive is expected.
